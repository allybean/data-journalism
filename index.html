      <h1 class="big">Data Journalism Final Project Pitch: The Future of New York</h1>     
    <h3> 1. New York is a transient city. So what does it look like today? Who are its constituents? The UN predicts that by 2050, over 67% of the world’s population will dwell in urban centers. What will our city look like 30 years from now? What are the trends in food security and housing security, and how will this affect things like healthcare or surveillance? By getting a better look at the trends sooner than later, our city can prepare for a long-term population influx. <br><br>
	This piece is an interactive map similar to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/09/19/nyregion/stop-and-frisk-is-all-but-gone-from-new-york.html">"Stop-and-Frisk" Map</a>, which would show a side by side comparison of the population of today’s New York and the future’s New York. Inside, different features would be revealed, like food security, health, housing, and policing/surveillance. Future population data is not exactly ready to download, but I could use the current projections and apply their algorithm to the projections for New York City. Available sources include a December 2006 report from The City of New York and The Department of City Planning on <a href = "http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/census/projections_briefing_booklet.pdf">New York City Population Projections by Age/Sex and Borough, 2000-2030</a> <br><br>
    I would use current census data and birth and life expectancy figures, and map the number of food, housing, and health facilities now to show how these may experience strain with the added number of people. <br><br>
	Since this map requires a lot of interaction to explore, I will need to develop my javascript skills, as well as going through many iterations of color and design in the map. I can go through food insecurity data from City Harvest, but also speak to someone in the NYC housing office about housing insecurity. <br><br>
    I would pitch this completed interactive story to the New York Times, New York Magazine, WYNYC, and The Atlantic. </h3>
  
 <p> 2. Who's Winning? The Nobel Peace Prize has recently been awarded to its recipients. What types of people are winning this world-renowned prize? Do they have any commonalities? Where do they come from, and how long do they work before they feel a sense of accomplishment? Does the Nobel electing committee change? How does that affect its winners? This will be an overview of the winners of the Nobel Peace Prize from its inception through now. I will start with preliminary sorts in gender, age, and occupation, and if any interesting trends emerge, document them to be made into a more focused piece. This story may also have a component of “how likely are you to win the Nobel Peace Prize?” to engage the reader, or to make them more aware of the selections the committee has made for the past 113 years. I would use Nobel Peace Prize recipient lists from every category since 1901. Most of the fun will be in using different intersections with the data. Gender vs. country, subject vs. country’s history, etc. The recipients attend the award ceremony on Dec 10, 2014, the day before the end of this data journalism class. I would pitch this finished piece to the New York Times and Time Magazine. </p>
<p>3. Pulse Map. I am interested in creating a map that illustrates activism happening in the United States in real time, by following and plotting twitter trends to their tweet location. The beauty of activism has been about being seen and heard, and a map that pin points issues by movements could raise consciousness, which are particularly frequent before elections. The pulse map would show a sonar circle around a location based on the number of tweets from that location. The frequency of tweets per minute, or however many times the API will allow the map to access the frequency, will also determine the speed of the blinking sonar ring. Like art, social activism inspires other social activism, so it would also be interesting to see the spread of large scale activism across time. It is usually a very intense time for cities to experience, and in a sense, the movements and protests act as its central pulse. This intermediate-high level web project would require learning how to code in javascript + apis. I would pitch this finished piece to the New York Times, Al Jazeera, and Quartz. </p>
