    <p>New York is a transient city. So what does it look like today? Who are its constituents? The UN predicts that by 2050, over 75% of the world’s population will dwell in urban centers. What will our city look like 40 years from now? What are the trends in food security, and housing security, and how will this affect things like healthcare or surveillance? By getting a better look at the trends sooner than later, our city can prepare for a long-term influx.

This would be an interactive map similar to the Stop and Frisk Map, which will show a side by side comparison of the population of today’s New York and the future’s New York. Inside that, different features would be revealed, like food security, health, housing, and protection or surveillance.

Future population data is not exactly ready to download, but I could use the current projections and apply their algorithm to the future population projections for New York City. I would use current census data and birth and life expectancy figures, and map the number of food, housing, and health facilities now to show how these may experience strain with the added number of people.

Since this map requires a lot of interaction to explore, I will need to develop my javascript skills, as well as going through many iterations of color and design in the map. I can go through food insecurity data from City Harvest, but also speak to someone in the NYC housing office about housing insecurity.

I would pitch this completed story to the New York Times.
